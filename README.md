# Table2KB
Matching the contents of a Web Table to a KB

This is **NOT** the code for the publication: V. Efthymiou, O. Hassanzadeh, M. Rodriguez-Muro, V. Christophides: Matching Web Tables with Knowledge Base Entities: From Entity Lookups to Entity Embeddings, ISWC 2017. 
It only includes some very early experimentation on this topic and it is nothing more than that. The code for the publication is not publicly available at the moment.
